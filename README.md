This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving undefined behavior when manipulating vectors with raw pointers.  The `bug.rs` file shows the problematic code, which modifies a vector using a raw pointer after potentially altering the vector's length.  The solution in `bugSolution.rs` provides a safer alternative, avoiding the use of raw pointers unless absolutely necessary and carefully managing memory.
